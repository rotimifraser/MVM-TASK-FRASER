# MVM-TASK-FRASER

Hello Valentine,

I hope this message finds you well.

Please find below a summary of the QA work I have completed for the Breach app based on the design files, shared API collection, and other available resources:

Product Requirements Document (PRD):
I have created a comprehensive PRD using the information provided, including the design specifications and API collection.

API Test Suite:
I developed an API test suite that can be easily imported into Postman. It is fully set up with dynamic variables—simply import the collection and click “Run.” No additional configuration is required.

Manual Test Case Document:
Leveraging my experience as a QA Analyst, I prepared a robust manual test case document that provides high-level test coverage of the product.
This includes:

Functional test cases

UI/UX validation

Compatibility testing across multiple browsers and screen sizes

Bug Report:
For clarity and efficiency, I have documented all identified bugs in a standardized bug report sheet. Each entry contains all necessary information including steps to reproduce, severity, and environment details.

Performance Testing:
I conducted:

A stress test simulating 100 users

A load test simulating 1,000 users
These focused on key user journeys and navigation areas.
The results, along with video recordings and screenshots, can be found in the attached Test Evidence folder.

Best regards,
Rotimi Fraser
